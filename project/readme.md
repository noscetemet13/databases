My project demonstrates grocery minimarkets across Kazakhstan. At the moment, the store has 5 branches throughout the country in 5 different cities.

In the projects folder there is a Project ER Model file that shows an updated version of the model from the midtherm.
The Non_frequent_shopper and Offline_order tables have been removed. 
Also new tables Phone_numbers and Cart have been added. 
In addition, the Stores table has been split into two: Stores and Products_in_stock for ease of use by the database. 
There are also changes in the attributes of some tables.


Also, there is a DDL file in the folder, which contains all the necessary queries to create tables, functions and indexes.
Indexes are created for three tables: payments, customers and products.
There is only one function: for calculating the age of a customer, taken from the 8th lab work.

The queries file contains queries from the 4th task. 
The first two queries work with the TOP20STORES and TOP20CITIES functions.
The other three queries work through SELECT queries.


And the insertion file contains all the data that was entered into the database to fill the tables.
